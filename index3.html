        As night falls on Hogsmeade village, “The Nighttime Lights at Hogwarts Castle” shines brightly with an awe-inspiring<br> 
        spectacle that showcases the four houses of Hogwarts: Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin and culminates<br> 
        with awesome beams of lights that fan into the night sky. The colorful state-of-the-art light display and special<br>
        effects projection is accompanied by a special musical arrangement created by Academy Award-winning composer John Williams<br> 
        based on his original scores composed for the film series. The musical arrangement that emanates in a surround sound<br>
        environment was conducted by prolific arranger William Ross and recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra in London.
